# ⚖️ Legal Handover Summary: Classified Data Room Infrastructure
**Date:** 2025-12-21
**Project Lead:** Dave D'Silva
**Classification:** TOP SECRET // Solicitor-Client Privilege

## ⚠️ National Security Notice
Following facilitation by the **RCMP** and **IP Canada**, this technology has been formally evaluated under the **Security of Information Act (SOIA)**. The Department of National Defence (DND) has designated the core Quantum Kinetic Fusion (QKF) and Arc Reactor propulsion schematics as **TOP SECRET**.

## 1. Governance & SOIA Compliance
* **SOP Enforcement:** The `qtlog` "Global SOP Gate" now serves as a technical control for SOIA-related audit trails.
* **Integrity Control:** Immutable hashing via `.sop_hash` is mandatory to prevent unauthorized disclosure or tampering.

## 2. IP Boundary & Classification
* **Public Tier (This Repository):** Contains only unclassified strategy, high-level capability statements, and non-proprietary governance frameworks.
* **Classified Tier (OFF-SITE/AIR-GAPPED):** Per RCMP/DND directive, all Top Secret schematics and math have been removed from public-facing infrastructure and are held under SOIA protocols.

## 3. Legal Readiness
The repository is structured to support the **Private Placement Memorandum (PPM)** while maintaining strict compliance with the **Security of Information Act**. Legal counsel must ensure all investor vetting aligns with DND/RCMP security clearance requirements.
