# 📑 Capability Statement: Quantum Trek (QT)
**Core Competency:** Mobile Quantum Kinetic Fusion (QKF) Power Systems

## 🚀 The Arc Reactor Advantage
* **Power Density:** Targeted 10x energy-to-weight ratio improvement over current tactical lithium-ion arrays.
* **Low Signature:** Designed for minimal thermal and acoustic detection, critical for "Silent Watch" missions.
* **Modular Integration:** Designed to fit within standard NATO pallet footprints for rapid FOB deployment.

## 🛠️ Technical Specifications (Unclassified Teaser)
* **System Output:** Scalable modules (50kW to 2MW).
* **Fuel Stability:** Utilizes stable isotopes; zero risk of "runaway" thermal events during transport.
* **Control Governance:** Real-time operational logging via the `qtlog` framework for high-fidelity audit trails.

## 🤝 Partners & Validation
* **Academic Lead:** Dr. Kumar, Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU).
* **IP Protection:** Multi-tier Data Room with mandatory NDA protocols (see docs/01_Legal).
