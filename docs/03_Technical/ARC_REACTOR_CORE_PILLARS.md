# ⚛️ Technical Teaser: Arc Reactor Core Pillars
**Document Status:** Public / Unclassified
**Project Lead:** Dave D'Silva

## 1. Beyond Legacy Muon-Catalyzed Fusion
While legacy models (circa 2016) focused on muon-catalyzed "Cold Spark" emitters, the Quantum Trek (QT) Arc Reactor utilizes **Non-Linear Flux Modulation**. This allows for stable containment without the loading-time bottlenecks seen in previous Alberta-lab iterations.

## 2. DND-Grade Precision Logging
Unlike previous unified blockchain attempts, QT utilizes a **Real-Time SOP Gate (qtlog)**. This ensures that every millisecond of experimental data is hashed and verified, meeting the 2025 DND/SOIA requirements for Top Secret data integrity.

## 3. Tactical Footprint
The QKF reactor is optimized for **Forward Operating Base (FOB)** deployment, providing a higher power-to-weight ratio than any previous "Energy Solutions" prototype.
