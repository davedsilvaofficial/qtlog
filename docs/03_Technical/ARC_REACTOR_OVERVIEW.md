# ⚛️ Project: Arc Reactor - Technical Executive Summary

## Objective
To develop a scalable, mobile Quantum Kinetic Fusion power source based on research initially conducted with Dr. Kumar (TMU).

## Core Pillars
* **Quantum Kinetic Fusion (QKF):** Leveraging high-efficiency particle interactions to generate clean energy.
* **Magnetic Containment:** Utilizing proprietary shielding math to ensure portable stability.
* **"Hero Tech" Applications:** Designed for dual-use in civilian emergency power and defense-grade propulsion.

## Intellectual Property Note
Specific flux-density calculations, fuel-cell geometry, and proprietary mathematics are classified under **Tier 2 (Private Vault)**. These details are available to authorized researchers and investors under NDA.

## Developmental Roadmap
1. **Phase I:** Documentation reconciliation and "Kumar Experiment" restart.
2. **Phase II:** Prototype containment testing.
3. **Phase III:** Full-scale Arc Reactor integration for mobile units.
