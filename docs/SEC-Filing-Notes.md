- Energy:
  - Grid-scale, “Energy Cloud 4.0”, Planetary Microgrid concept
- Defense:
  - Advanced propulsion, fusion, command-and-control systems
- Finance:
  - Risk, portfolio optimization, and capital formation
- Workforce & Education:
  - Advanced manufacturing, SDF, QuantumKid pipeline

---

## 5. Legal & Regulatory Considerations (Notes)

- Securities:
  - Private placement memorandum (PPM)
  - Future IPO / SEC S-1 or equivalent
- Export controls / defense:
  - DOD / ITAR / national security considerations
- IP:
  - Patents, trade secrets, know-how, prior art

---

## 6. Risk Factors (Brainstorm List)

_(Rough list for now; later we’ll formalize and sanitize language.)_

- Technical risk: feasibility, timelines, dependence on bleeding-edge tech
- Regulatory risk: export controls, nuclear/defense constraints
- Capital risk: scale of funding required vs current state
- Execution risk: team size, hiring, dependency on key individuals
- Market risk: adoption by utilities, defense, governments, investors

---

## 7. Use of Proceeds (Draft Buckets)

High-level buckets (numbers later):

- R&D (fusion, propulsion, quantum tooling)
- Productization (platform, software, integration)
- Partnerships (universities, utilities, defense, industry)
- Governance & compliance (legal, SEC, audits)
- Community / ecosystem (QuantumQid, outreach)

---

## 8. Next Actions – Filing Prep

1. Confirm corporate structure and cap table doc sources.
2. Align PPM content and this notes file (cross-reference).
3. Identify law firm(s) and SEC counsel for formal processes.
4. Build internal data room structure (folders, permissions, naming).
5. Sync with WBS Master so every item here has:
   - WBS ID
   - Owner
   - Timeline
   - Status

---

## 9. Links & References (to be filled)

- GitHub repo(s):
  - `qtlog` – logging + SOPs
  - (future) core tech repos
- Notion:
  - QT ▸ Log
  - Project pages (QuantumFusion, QuantumQid, etc.)
- External:
  - University partners
  - Government programs (SDF, etc.)
