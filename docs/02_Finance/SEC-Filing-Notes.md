## 2. Track Record & Proof Points

### Enterprise / Finance
- **PriceMetrix / Intelligent Market Solutions Group (IMSG)**  
  ~$6T in assets tracked using proprietary math models and optimized advisory intelligence.

### Energy & Aerospace
- **QuantumFusion — historic work**  
  1995 defense program: “Last Manned Fighter” (DND / DOD / Lockheed) — nuclear-powered Mach-34 VTOL air-space craft.  
  Developed fusion-based propulsion concepts and power systems, including an early arc reactor prototype.

- **QuantumFusion — academic collaboration**  
  Prior work with aerospace faculty at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson).  
  Joint interest to continue experimentation and validation.

### Logistics & Industrial Optimization
- **Seaport optimization (DP World UAE)**  
  Quantum mathematical approach to container stacking optimization for unloading efficiency.

### Community & Human Capital
- **Quantum QID**  
  Youth technology and skills accelerator building pathways into next-generation engineering and quantum-inspired problem solving.  
  Designed around **real-world application**, not classroom theory.

> **TO DO:** Each bullet should become a clean, factual paragraph with dates, outcomes, and corroborating evidence.

## 5. Legal & Regulatory Considerations

### Securities
- Private Placement Memorandum (PPM)  
- Future SEC filing for public listing (S-1 or similar)

### Nuclear/Energy
- Fusion-related regulatory pathways  
- Jurisdiction-specific requirements for experimental platforms  
- Export controls and national-security alignment

### Intellectual Property
- Patent strategy  
- IP assignments and provenance (IMSG → Quantum Trek)  
- R&D artifacts tied to defense programs  
- Data room will require evidence of ownership and chain of custody.

### Defense
- DOD/DND involvement  
- ITAR implications  
- Sensitive technology disclosure frameworks

> **TO DO:** Work with legal counsel for correct classification of historical programs.

## 6. Risk Factors (Brainstorm Only)

- Technical feasibility and research timelines  
- Regulatory and export-control uncertainty  
- Capital requirements for experimental energy systems  
- Concentration of knowledge with core founding team  
- Defense program dependency risks  
- Market adoption risks in highly regulated sectors  
- Communications and reputational considerations

> **TO DO:** Convert into formal risk-factor language with counsel.
