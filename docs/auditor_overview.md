# qtlog Documentation Governance Overview

## Purpose
This repository enforces deterministic, auditable, and reversible operational workflows for software, documentation, and credential handling.

## Authority Model
All actions are governed by a formal SOP and validated by automation where possible.

## Key Documents

- **MASTER_INDEX.md** — Canonical map of repository scope
- **SOP.md** — Highest operational authority
- **SECURITY.md** — Information boundary control
- **RELEASE.md** — CI-validated release state
- **CHANGELOG.md** — Chronological development history
- **AUDITOR_README.md** — External review entry point

## Enforcement
- CI validates release formatting
- SOP defines copy discipline
- Security boundaries are explicit

## Traceability
Every release and SOP change is tagged and auditable.
