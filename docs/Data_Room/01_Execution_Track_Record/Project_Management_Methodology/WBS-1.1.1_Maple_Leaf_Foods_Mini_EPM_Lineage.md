## Why this document exists

The qtlog / AI-assisted execution system is **not a greenfield invention**.

It is a direct evolution of a **real, revenue-critical transformation** executed at  
**Maple Leaf Foods (MLF)** — a $4B+ annual revenue manufacturer.

This document establishes **lineage and credibility**.

## The original transformation (executed)

**Organization:** Maple Leaf Foods  
**Scale:** Thousands of employees, multiple plants  
**Revenue preserved during transformation:** ~$4B annually  
**Transformation scale:** ~$1B network modernization

### What was delivered

- Transition from **manual operations → automated / robotic manufacturing**
- Introduction of **Six Sigma discipline**
- Deployment of **Microsoft Project Server–based Mini-EPM**
- Hybrid **ERP + execution governance** model
- Zero-loss revenue continuity during transformation

This was **not theoretical**.
It was executed inside a live manufacturing environment.

## Why it matters to qtlog

The original Mini-EPM proved:

- Large populations can be aligned under a single execution model
- Governance can coexist with speed
- Revenue does not need to be sacrificed for modernization
- Discipline beats heroics

The **qtlog system builds on this**, adding:

- Automation instead of manual governance
- AI-assisted coordination (“vibe coding” for execution)
- Deterministic logging and audit trails
- Tool-enforced SOPs instead of human memory

qtlog is the **next generation** of the same execution philosophy.

## Positioning statement (for investors)

> “qtlog is not an experiment.  
> It is the automation of an execution model already proven  
> at billion-dollar manufacturing scale.”
