## What This Compliance Run Represents

This repository enforces **governance as code**.

The “Compliance” and “Release PDF (One-Pager)” workflows are not cosmetic CI jobs — they are
**active control mechanisms** that ensure Quantum Trek’s operating documentation cannot drift
without detection.

### What Happens During a Compliance Release

When a governance tag (for example, `v2026.01.06-compliance-pdf`) is created:

1. **A clean, reproducible environment is launched**
   - GitHub Actions (`ubuntu-latest`)
   - Containerized Pandoc + LaTeX toolchain
   - No reliance on developer machines

2. **Compliance artifacts are built, not uploaded**
   - `ONE_PAGER.md` is rendered into a PDF
   - Output is deterministic and reproducible
   - Human-readable and auditor-ready

3. **Artifacts are cryptographically bound**
   - PDF is attached to a GitHub Release
   - Release is tied to a signed Git tag
   - Timestamped and immutable

4. **Verification is enforced**
   - Notion → GitHub linkage is validated via API
   - Only the explicitly labeled **“New Navigation Block”**
     in *QT – Big Picture* is authoritative
   - Any drift causes a hard failure

### Why This Matters

This system ensures:

- **No silent documentation drift**
- **No manual compliance evidence**
- **No unverifiable governance claims**
- **Binary pass/fail enforcement**

Compliance is **generated by execution**, not policy.

### How Auditors and Investors Should Interpret This

The presence of:
- a signed compliance tag,
- a passing CI run,
- a generated PDF artifact,
- and an immutable release,

demonstrates that governance controls are:

- automated,
- continuously enforced,
- and externally verifiable.

This is **institutional-grade, audit-ready infrastructure**.
