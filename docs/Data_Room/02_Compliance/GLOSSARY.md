# Governance & Compliance Glossary

This glossary explains key terms used in the Quantum Trek Data Room for
investors, auditors, and non-technical reviewers.

## CI — Continuous Integration

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is an automated enforcement system that
executes governance and compliance controls every time a change is proposed.

In this repository, CI means:
- Governance rules are executed automatically
- No change can enter the main branch unless all checks pass
- Evidence is generated by execution, not human assertion

---

## PR — Pull Request

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a formal, reviewable request to merge changes into
the authoritative branch.

In this repository:
- All changes to `main` must go through a PR
- PRs are blocked unless CI passes
- PRs require at least one approving review

---

## Compliance / verify

A required CI control that enforces:
- Notion ↔ GitHub drift detection
- Strict bottom-only “New Navigation Block” enforcement
- Required Data Room artifacts

Failure blocks all merges.

---

## Governance Epoch

A **Governance Epoch** is a cryptographically anchored, point-in-time baseline
where governance controls were enforced and passed.

Each epoch includes:
- A signed Git tag
- A passing CI run
- Immutable evidence artifacts
- A GitHub Release

---

## Governance-as-Code

Governance rules expressed as executable logic and enforced automatically,
eliminating manual policy enforcement.

---

## Branch Protection

A GitHub control that prevents changes from entering the main branch unless
all required checks and approvals succeed.
