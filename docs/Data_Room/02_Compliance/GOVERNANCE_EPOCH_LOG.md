Each epoch represents a cryptographically anchored, auditor-verifiable baseline
where governance controls were enforced and passed.

## Governance Epoch — 2026-01-06

**Epoch Tag:** `v2026.01.06-governance-epoch`  
**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Established:** 2026-01-06 (ET)

### What Changed at This Epoch

This epoch marks the transition from *policy-based governance* to
**governance enforced by code**.

The following controls became mandatory and non-bypassable:

- Compliance verification via GitHub Actions
- Strict bottom-only “New Navigation Block” enforcement
- Notion ↔ GitHub drift detection via API
- Branch protection requiring:
  - Passing `Compliance / verify`
  - At least 1 approving PR review
  - Admin enforcement enabled

### Evidence Anchors

- **Git Tag:** `v2026.01.06-governance-epoch`
- **Release:**  
  https://github.com/davedsilvaofficial/qtlog/releases/tag/v2026.01.06-governance-epoch
- **Compliance Record:** `docs/Data_Room/COMPLIANCE_BADGE.md`
- **Investor Index:** `docs/Data_Room/INVESTOR_DATA_ROOM_INDEX.md`
- **SOC 2 / ISO Mapping:** `docs/Data_Room/02_Compliance/SOC2_ISO27001_MAPPING.md`

### Institutional Interpretation

From this point forward:

- Silent documentation drift is impossible
- Governance violations are detected automatically
- Compliance evidence is generated by execution, not assertion

This epoch establishes an **institutional-grade control environment**
suitable for investor, auditor, and regulatory review.
