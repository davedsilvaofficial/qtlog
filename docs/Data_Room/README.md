# QT Data Room — External Disclosure Index

_Last updated: 2026-01-05_

## How to read this Data Room (for investors)

This Data Room provides a **frozen, investor-safe view** of how Quantum Trek
manages complexity, execution, and governance at scale.

It is designed to answer four questions clearly:
1. What is the method?
2. Is it enforced or just described?
3. How has it evolved over time?
4. Can it be trusted under audit?

This Data Room is **read-only by design**.

## How this fits the QT Big Picture

This Data Room corresponds to the **“Data Room → external disclosure”** layer
described in the QT – Big Picture.

It provides a frozen view of:
- the canonical method,
- its operational enforcement,
- and its audited evolution.

Live planning and narrative live in **Notion**.  
Truth-at-time-of-action is recorded by **qtlog**.

## Governance Note (Important)

Notion **explains** the system.  
It does **not** define or enforce it.

- Governance rules are defined in **code**
- Enforcement happens at **execution time**
- Changes are tracked in **Git history and CHANGELOG.md**

This separation ensures investor, auditor, and government confidence.
