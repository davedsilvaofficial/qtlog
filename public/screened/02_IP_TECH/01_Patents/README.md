# Patents (Selective Strategy)

This folder contains patent filings, applications, or provisional materials
for IP assets that have been intentionally selected for patent protection.

Notes:
- Not all IP is patented by design.
- Patent filings are used selectively where disclosure risk is outweighed
  by enforceability and strategic value.

Suggested contents:
- Patent_<Jurisdiction>_<ApplicationOrGrantNo>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.pdf
- Provisional_<Title>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.pdf
- Patent_Strategy_Notes_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md
