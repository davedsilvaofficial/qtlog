# 🛡️ Quantum Trek Security & IP Protection Policy

## Overview
Quantum Trek (QT) operates at the intersection of "Hero Tech" development and defense-grade scientific research. This document outlines how we protect our Intellectual Property (IP), including Quantum Kinetic Fusion specifications and Arc Reactor schematics.

## Data Classification
We maintain a strict boundary between public project management and private technical data:

1. **Public Tier (qtlog):** Version control, logging utilities, and public roadmap.
2. **Private Tier (qt-vault):** Proprietary math, Dr. Kumar's verified correspondence, and PPM financial data.

## Accessing the Private Data Room
Access to the Private Vault/Data Room is restricted to authorized personnel, including:
* Licensed Legal Counsel
* Vetted PhD Research Candidates
* Verified Defense Department Officials (DND/DoD)

**Requirement:** Access requires a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). Please contact your project lead to initiate the vetting process.
